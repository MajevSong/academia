This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of feature extraction (FE) methods across all major signal processing domains and various types of BCIs, addressing a significant gap in existing reviews and surveys that often focus exclusively on EEG‐based systems. Also, a detailed comparative analysis of FE techniques, highlighting their formulas, advantages, limitations, and practical applications, is provided. The study not only reviews state‐of‐the‐art methods but also evaluates recent research, identifying trends and gaps in the field. Key insights reveal a growing foundation for invasive BCI research, which, while currently limited, shows promise for future advancements. Based on this analysis, we identify and discuss open challenges such as inter‐subject variability, real‐time processing demands, integration of multiple modalities, and user training and adaptation. Additionally, we examine pressing concerns related to security, privacy, and the transferability of models. By addressing these challenges, this paper aims to guide the development of robust, efficient, and inclusive BCI systems, paving the way for cutting‐edge innovations and real‐world applications.

A systematic review on electroencephalographic (EEG)-based feature extraction strategies to diagnosis and therapy of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children is presented. The analysis is realized at an executive function level to improve the research of neurocorrelates of heterogeneous disorders such as ADHD. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (QATQS) and field-weighted citation impact metric (Scopus) were used to assess the methodological rigor of the studies and their impact on the scientific community, respectively. One hundred and one articles, concerning the diagnostics and therapy of ADHD children aged from 8 to 14, were collected. Event-related potential components were mainly exploited for executive functions related to the cluster inhibition, whereas band power spectral density is the most considered EEG feature for executive functions related to the cluster working memory. This review identifies the most used (also by rigorous and relevant articles) EEG signal processing strategies for executive function assessment in ADHD.

Electroencephalography (EEG) feature extraction plays a fundamental role in translating raw neural signals into meaningful representations for applications such as neurological diagnostics, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and cognitive state monitoring. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of mathematical approaches employed in EEG feature extraction, categorized into time, frequency, time-frequency and nonlinear domains. In addition to reviewing existing methods, an experimental study was conducted using real EEG data from the Bonn University dataset. Features including statistical descriptors, Hjorth parameters, band powers, spectral entropy, approximate entropy, fractal dimension, Hurst exponent, and Lempel-Ziv complexity were systematically extracted and compared between healthy and seizure recordings. Furthermore, timefrequency representations were generated using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to capture transient and non-stationary dynamics. The results demonstrate that a multi-domain feature extraction strategy significantly enhances the ability to characterize and discriminate pathological EEG signals. Key challenges such as data variability, limited dataset availability, and the need for standardized analysis pipelines are also discussed, along with future directions including the development of benchmark datasets, explainable AI-driven feature selection, and real-time EEG processing optimization. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental validation, this study aims to support the development of more reliable, interpretable, and scalable EEG-based systems for scientific and clinical use.

**Authors:** E. Gkintoni, Anthimos Aroutzidis, H. Antonopoulou, C. Halkiopoulos (2025)
**DOI/URL:** 10.3390/brainsci15030220

Background/Objectives: This systematic review presents how neural and emotional networks are integrated into EEG-based emotion recognition, bridging the gap between cognitive neuroscience and practical applications. Methods: Following PRISMA, 64 studies were reviewed that outlined the latest feature extraction and classification developments using deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs. Results: Indeed, the findings showed that the multimodal approaches were practical, especially the combinations involving EEG with physiological signals, thus improving the accuracy of classification, even surpassing 90% in some studies. Key signal processing techniques used during this process include spectral features, connectivity analysis, and frontal asymmetry detection, which helped enhance the performance of recognition. Despite these advances, challenges remain more significant in real-time EEG processing, where a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency limits practical implementation. High computational cost is prohibitive to the use of deep learning models in real-world applications, therefore indicating a need for the development and application of optimization techniques. Aside from this, the significant obstacles are inconsistency in labeling emotions, variation in experimental protocols, and the use of non-standardized datasets regarding the generalizability of EEG-based emotion recognition systems. Discussion: These challenges include developing adaptive, real-time processing algorithms, integrating EEG with other inputs like facial expressions and physiological sensors, and a need for standardized protocols for emotion elicitation and classification. Further, related ethical issues with respect to privacy, data security, and machine learning model biases need to be much more proclaimed to responsibly apply research on emotions to areas such as healthcare, human–computer interaction, and marketing. Conclusions: This review provides critical insight into and suggestions for further development in the field of EEG-based emotion recognition toward more robust, scalable, and ethical applications by consolidating current methodologies and identifying their key limitations.

**DOI/URL:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/40820bf68025713bbd3e7bcece49c63bf3a6aacd

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been widely applied to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) signals for disease diagnosis and brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The integration of multimodal data has been shown to enhance the accuracy of ML and DL models. Combining EEG with other modalities can improve clinical decision-making by addressing complex tasks in clinical populations. This systematic literature review explores the use of multimodal EEG data in ML and DL models for clinical applications. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, yielding 16 relevant studies after three rounds of filtering. These studies demonstrate the application of multimodal EEG data in addressing clinical challenges, including neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological conditions (e.g., seizure detection), neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), and sleep stage classification. Data fusion occurred at three levels: signal, feature, and decision levels. The most commonly used ML models were support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees. Notably, 11 out of the 16 studies reported improvements in model accuracy with multimodal EEG data. This review highlights the potential of multimodal EEG-based ML models in enhancing clinical diagnostics and problem-solving.

**Authors:** Alireza Dabbaghian, Hossein Kassiri (2024)
**DOI/URL:** 10.1109/CICC60959.2024.10529012

Wearable EEG headsets have shown potential to transform outpatient diagnostics by providing real-time insights into brain neurological activity, allowing for more accurate treatment plans. For most diagnostic applications, energy-efficient design is crucial due to the need for long-term recording. Diagnostic headsets typically consist of multiple active electrodes (AE) with embedded electronics for amplification and/or quantization, connected to a central back-end (BE) unit responsible for data processing and, if necessary, wireless transmission. As shown in Fig. 1 (top, left), a review of the state of the art reveals that in systems with a sufficiently-high dynamic range (DR) analog front-end (AFE) [1] and a data-driven classifier (e.g., a nonlinear support vector machine (NL-SVM) [2]) for seizure detection, power consumption is mainly dominated by the AFE (47.6%), AE-to-BE data communication (26.5%), and signal processing for seizure detection (20.6%). This emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to enhance the efficiency of all these major components for an overall energy-efficient design.

## 13. Advances in Infant Cry Paralinguistic Classification—Methods, Implementation, and Applications: Systematic Review

**Authors:** Geofrey Owino, Bernard Bernard Shibwabo (2024)
**DOI/URL:** 10.2196/69457

Background Effective communication is essential for human interaction; yet, infants can only express their needs through various types of suggestive cries. Traditional approaches of interpreting infant cries are often subjective, inconsistent, and slow, leaving gaps in timely, precise caregiving responses. A precise interpretation of infant cries can potentially provide valuable insights into the infant’s health, needs, and well-being, enabling prompt medical or caregiving actions. Objective This study seeks to systematically review the advancements in methods, coverage, deployment schemes, and applications of infant cry classification over the last 24 years. The review focuses on the different infant cry classification techniques, feature extraction methods, and practical applications. Furthermore, we aimed to identify recent trends and directions in the field of infant cry signal processing to address both academic and practical needs. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted using 9 electronic databases: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, JSTOR, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, PubMed, ACM, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. A total of 5904 search results were initially retrieved, with 126 studies meeting the eligibility criteria after screening by 2 independent reviewers. The methodological quality of these studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (version 2; RoB2), with 92% (n=116) of the studies indicating a low risk of bias and 8% (n=10) of the studies showing some concerns regarding bias. The overall quality assessment was performed using TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis) guidelines. The data analysis was conducted using R (version 3.64; R Foundation). Results Notable advancements in infant cry classification methods were realized, particularly from 2019 onward, using machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. Common audio features included Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, spectrograms, pitch, duration, intensity, formants, 0-crossing rate, and chroma. Deployment methods included mobile apps and web-based platforms for real-time analysis, with 90% (n=113) of the remaining models remaining undeployed to real-world applications. Denoising techniques and federated learning were limitedly used to enhance model robustness and ensure data confidentiality from 5% (n=6) of the studies. Some of the practical applications spanned health care monitoring, diagnostics, and caregiver support. Conclusions The evolution of infant cry classification methods has progressed from traditional classical statistical methods to machine learning models but with minimal considerations of data privacy, confidentiality, and ultimate deployment to practical use. Further research is thus proposed to develop standardized foundational audio multimodal approaches, incorporating a broader range of audio features and ensuring data confidentiality through methods such as federated learning. Furthermore, a preliminary layer is proposed for denoising the cry signal before the feature extraction stage. These improvements will enhance the accuracy, generalizability, and practical applicability of infant cry classification models in diverse health care settings.

Machine learning (ML) has achieved substantial success in performing healthcare tasks in which the configuration of every part of the ML pipeline relies heavily on technical knowledge. To help professionals with borderline expertise to better use ML techniques, Automated ML (AutoML) has emerged as a prospective solution. However, most models generated by AutoML are black boxes that are challenging to comprehend and deploy in healthcare settings. We conducted a systematic review to examine AutoML with interpretation systems for healthcare. We searched four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) complemented with seven prestigious ML conferences (AAAI, ACL, ICLR, ICML, IJCAI, KDD, and NeurIPS) that reported AutoML with interpretation for healthcare before September 1, 2023. We included 118 articles related to AutoML with interpretation in healthcare. First, we illustrated AutoML techniques used in the included publications, including automated data preparation, automated feature engineering, and automated model development, accompanied by a real‐world case study to demonstrate the advantages of AutoML over classic ML. Then, we summarized interpretation methods: feature interaction and importance, data dimensionality reduction, intrinsically interpretable models, and knowledge distillation and rule extraction. Finally, we detailed how AutoML with interpretation has been used for six major data types: image, free text, tabular data, signal, genomic sequences, and multi‐modality. To some extent, AutoML with interpretation provides effortless development and improves users' trust in ML in healthcare settings. In future studies, researchers should explore automated data preparation, seamless integration of automation and interpretation, compatibility with multi‐modality, and utilization of foundation models.

Background Childhood brain tumours, even though rare, present with significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. Radiomics involves feature extraction that is data-driven from standard imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In paediatric brain tumour imaging, MRI is often preferred because it is non-invasive and avoids exposure to radiation, making it safer for children. Radiomic features reveal additional information about tumour morphology and heterogeneity. By integrating biological meaning into imaging data, this approach enhances our understanding of tumour biology, thus supporting improved classification, treatment planning and management. Purpose This review focuses on MRI-based radiomics for the diagnosis and prognosis of childhood brain tumours. It assesses various approaches used in image pre-processing, tumour segmentation, feature extraction, and predictive model development to understand their accuracy and outcome, while it aims to understand the biological meaning and interpretation of radiomic features. Methods A systematic review was conducted, including 559 MRI-based radiomics studies in PubMed and Engineering Village Compendex databases, following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PROSPERO registration: CRD42024503524). Data extraction focused on age, sample size, tumour type, pre-processing techniques, segmentation methods, feature extraction, and performance metrics. Results Nineteen studies were included, primarily addressing ependymoma (EP) and medulloblastoma (MB). Common pre-processing methods included intensity normalisation (n = 11) and bias correction (n = 4). GLCM (n = 12) and GLRLM (n = 7) were frequently used features, with LASSO (n = 8) and PCA (n = 2) as leading selection methods. SVM was the most used classification algorithm (n = 9), with an AUC range of 0.858–0.977. We have included the biological meaning and clinical significance of radiomic features to further understand why these insights are important. Conclusion While challenges such as limited datasets and varied imaging protocols exist, we recommend identifying and integrating the most informative radiomic features to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in childhood brain tumours, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Biometics such as fingerprint, face, and iris are vulnerable to spoof attacks. The unique characteristics of Electroencephalography (EEG) make it a promising biometric modality especially because of its resistance to spoofing attacks. Many deep learning methods have been proposed for EEG-based biometric systems. This systematic review examines these methods in terms of their feature extraction ability and authentication performance. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Springer databases. Initially, we identified 285 relevant articles published between 2018 and 2024. After removing duplicates and applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 of them were selected and investigated thoroughly. This review highlights that deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformers have been applied in EEG biometric systems. These architectures are capable of automatically extracting discriminative features from raw EEG signals without the need for feature engineering. They achieved a high identification or verification performance with over 90% accuracy and a low Equal Error Rate (EER). However, challenges persist with these models, such as generalizability and adaptability across diverse datasets and subjects, and the long-term stability of EEG signatures over time. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and generalizable solutions. This review consolidates EEG-based deep learning developments, identifies common trends and gaps, and provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of EEG biometrics, thereby serving as a comprehensive reference for this field. Key future directions are proposed, including the design of hybrid deep learning architectures, leveraging transfer learning techniques, and conducting rigorous cross-subject evaluations to further improve the generalizability and real-world reliability of EEG-based biometric systems.

We extract trends and highlight interesting approaches from this large body of literature to inform future research and formulate recommendations. To find relevant papers published in scientific journals, conferences, and electronic preprint repositories, researchers searched major databases covering the domains of science and engineering. For each investigation, many data items about (1) the data, (2) the channels used, (3) the extraction and classification procedure, and (4) the outcomes were extracted. These items were then analyzed one by one to uncover trends. Our analysis reveals that the amount of EEG data used across studies varies. We saw that more than half the studies used simulation driving experimental. About 21% of the studies used support vector machine (SVM), while 19% used convolutional neural networks (CNN). Overall, we can conclude that drowsiness and fatigue impair driving performance, resulting in drivers who are more exposed to risky situations.

Most of the tools available for EEG signal analysis use machine learning to extract the required information. So, the study of robust techniques for feature extraction and classification is an important thing to understand the practical use of EEG. The paper aims that if there is any special tool for a particular task. Which feature domain or classifier has a significant role in EEG signal analysis? Approach: It presents a detailed report of the current trend for bio-electrical signals classification focusing on various classifiers’ advantages and disadvantages. This study includes literature from 2000 to 2021 with a brief description of EEG signal origin and advancement in classification techniques. Results: Randomly used classifiers for EEG signal can be categorized into five classes, namely Linear Classifiers, Nearest Neighbor Classifiers, Nonlinear Bayesian Classifiers, Neural Networks, and Combinations of Classifiers. Approximately 40% of studies use Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbor, and their combination with others. For specific tasks, particular classifiers are recommended in the survey. Features can be defined into four categories, namely TDFs, FDFs, TFDFs, and statistical features, where 39% of studies used TFDFs. Multi-domains features are preferred when the required information cannot be obtained from one domain. Significance: The paper summarizes the recent approaches for feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. It describes the brain waves with their classification, related behavior, and task with the physiological correlation. The comparative analysis of different classifiers, toolbox, the channel used, accuracy, and the number of subjects from various studies can help the practitioners choose a suitable classifier. Furthermore, future directions can cope up with the relevant problems and can lead to accurate classification.

**Authors:** B. Mdluli, Philani Khumalo, Rito Clifford Maswanganyi (2025)
**DOI/URL:** 10.3390/app152212075

Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) technology facilitates direct communication between the human brain and external devices by interpreting brain wave patterns associated with specific motor imagery tasks, which are derived from EEG signals. Although BCIs allow applications such as robotic arm control and smart assistive environments, they face major challenges, mainly due to the large variation in EEG characteristics between and within individuals. This variability is caused by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to both physiological and non-physiological artifacts, which severely affect the detection rate (IDR) in BCIs. Advanced multi-stage signal processing pipelines, including efficient filtering and decomposition techniques, have been developed to address these problems. Additionally, numerous feature engineering techniques have been developed to identify highly discriminative features, mainly to enhance IDRs in BCIs. In this review, several pre-processing techniques, including feature extraction algorithms, are critically evaluated using deep learning techniques. The review comparatively discusses methods such as wavelet-based thresholding and independent component analysis (ICA), including empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its more sophisticated variants, such as Self-Adaptive Multivariate EMD (SA-MEMD) and Ensemble EMD (EEMD). These methods are examined based on machine learning models using SVM, LDA, and deep learning techniques such as CNNs and PCNNs, highlighting key limitations and findings, including different performance metrics. The paper concludes by outlining future directions.

Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored DR algorithms and their application in future research.

Numerous studies have investigated the detection of AUD using EEG signals. However, the real-world implementation of diagnostic systems is hindered by users’ difficulty in understanding the rationale behind a decision. This study presents a systematic literature review based on PRISMA guidelines, utilizing journal and conference articles from 2019 to 2023 obtained from Scopus. Among 66 collected studies, feature engineering techniques dominated by EEG sub band decomposition processes, followed by time-domain feature extraction, EEG conversion to images, and brain connectivity features. With advancements in computation, comprehensive hybrid features and raw EEG data are emerging as inputs for classifiers. Some studies also use dimensionality reduction techniques such as statistical analysis, optimization methods, feature reduction methods, and manual selection. Moreover, while black box classifier models are widely used, intrinsically interpretable classifiers exhibit no significant differences in accuracy performance.

How to efficiently tag the emotional experience of multimedia contents is an important and challenging problem in the field of affective computing. This paper presents an EEG-based real-time emotion tagging approach, by extracting inter-brain features from a group of participants when they watch the same emotional video clips. First, the continuous subjective reports on both the arousal and valence dimensions of emotion were obtained by employing a three-round behavioral rating paradigm. Second, the inter-brain features were systematically explored in both spectral and temporal domain. Finally, regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of inter-brain amplitude and phase features. The inter-brain amplitude feature showed significantly better prediction performance than the inter-brain phase feature, as well as another two conventional features (spectral power and inter-subject correlation). By combining the four types of features, regression values (R<sup>2</sup>) were obtained for the prediction of arousal (<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">${{0.61}}\pm {{0.01}}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>61</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="zhang-ieq1-2849758.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>) and valence (<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">${{0.70}}\pm {{0.01}}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>70</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="zhang-ieq2-2849758.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>), corresponding to prediction errors of <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">${{1.01}}\pm {{0.02}}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>01</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>02</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="zhang-ieq3-2849758.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">${{0.78}}\pm {{0.02}}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>78</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>02</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="zhang-ieq4-2849758.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (unit on 9-point scales), respectively.

Epileptic seizure is one of the most chronic neurological diseases that instantaneously disrupts the lifestyle of affected individuals. Toward developing novel and efficient technology for epileptic seizure management, recent diagnostic approaches have focused on developing machine/deep learning model (ML/DL)-based electroencephalogram (EEG) methods. Importantly, EEG's noninvasiveness and ability to offer repeated patterns of epileptic-related electrophysiological information have motivated the development of varied ML/DL algorithms for epileptic seizure diagnosis in the recent years. However, EEG's low amplitude and nonstationary characteristics make it difficult for existing ML/DL models to achieve a consistent and satisfactory diagnosis outcome, especially in clinical settings, where environmental factors could hardly be avoided. Though several recent works have explored the use of EEG-based ML/DL methods and statistical feature for seizure diagnosis, it is unclear what the advantages and limitations of these works are, which might preclude the advancement of research and development in the field of epileptic seizure diagnosis and appropriate criteria for selecting ML/DL models and statistical feature extraction methods for EEG-based epileptic seizure diagnosis. Therefore, this paper attempts to bridge this research gap by conducting an extensive systematic review on the recent developments of EEG-based ML/DL technologies for epileptic seizure diagnosis. In the review, current development in seizure diagnosis, various statistical feature extraction methods, ML/DL models, their performances, limitations, and core challenges as applied in EEG-based epileptic seizure diagnosis were meticulously reviewed and compared. In addition, proper criteria for selecting appropriate and efficient feature extraction techniques and ML/DL models for epileptic seizure diagnosis were also discussed. Findings from this study will aid researchers in deciding the most efficient ML/DL models with optimal feature extraction methods to improve the performance of EEG-based epileptic seizure detection.

Classification is one of the main applications of machine learning, which can group and classify the cases based on learning and development using the available data and experience knowledge. Classification is used widely in biological and medical aspects. This paper presents the problem of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification. Classification is the step of identifying groups or classes based on similarities between them. This step is essential to differentiate between seizure and normal periods. EEG is a monitoring tool to determine the electrical activity of the brain. The nature of EEG is quite long, so it consumes time and very difficult in processing. Epilepsy is an illness that affects people of all ages, both cases males and females. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that makes the activities of the brain abnormal and generates seizures. Seizure symptoms vary from one people to another; it depends on the location of epileptic discharge in the cortex. To speed up the classification process and make it efficient, EEG signal needs to be preprocessed. This paper reviews the epilepsy mentality disorder and the types of seizure, preprocessing operations that performed on EEG data, a common extracted feature from the signal, and detailed view on classification techniques that can be used in this problem.

## 47. A Systematic Review of EEG Studies on the Neural Effects of Quran Listening

**Authors:** Hamid Majidi, Alireza Rajabi-Tavakkol (2025)
**DOI/URL:** 10.18502/ijps.v20i2.18206

Objective: This systematic review aims to explore the effects of listening to the Quran on the electrophysiological aspects of the human brain, particularly focusing on how this auditory experience influences cognitive function, emotional well-being, and mental health. Method : We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using keywords such as "Quran" and "EEG." Studies included in this review were observational or clinical trials that investigated the effects of Quran listening on brain activity using EEG. Eligibility criteria were assessed according to predefined standards, with a focus on studies published in English. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was employed to evaluate the quality of the selected articles, and data extraction followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 236 studies were evaluated, leading to the inclusion of 22 eligible studies in this review. Findings indicate that listening to Quranic verses is associated with increased alpha and theta power, which correlates with relaxation and improved emotional states in participants, including non-Muslims. The review identified significant variations in study designs, methodologies, and quality, with many studies displaying a high risk of bias. Conclusion: Listening to Quranic verses demonstrates potential therapeutic effects by activating brain regions associated with relaxation and emotional regulation. Despite promising findings, the current body of research is limited, particularly regarding nonlinear EEG dynamics and comprehensive study designs. Further neuroimaging and clinical investigations are warranted to validate these results and explore the therapeutic applications of Quranic listening in diverse contexts, such as pain management, psychological health, and rehabilitation.

**Authors:** Jeniffer Xin-Ying Lek, J. Teo (2023)
**DOI/URL:** 10.1155/2023/9790005

Facial emotion expressions are among the most potent, natural, and powerful means of human communication. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions worldwide are forced to switch rapidly to remote and online learning. Students are currently in an emergency state and must adapt to various and readily accessible learning methods, such as mobile learning applications or an e-learning system. A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted to extract and synthesize information such as the emotion classifier used in the facial expression recognition (FER) system, the dataset used, the preprocessing technique applied, the feature extraction approach used, and the strength and limitation of the previous studies. Based on the search criteria, 701 publications were initially retrieved from five different digital databases, of which 48 studies have been chosen as primary studies for further analysis. Based on the findings of this study, the deep learning approach is the most frequently adopted approach in classifying student emotions during online learning. FER-2013 is the most commonly used FER dataset in FER studies, while DAiSEE is the most used academic emotion dataset. Moreover, support vector machine (SVM) is the conventional learning emotion classifier that is widely used in the FER systems, while convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most frequently used deep learning classifier. Next, it was found that the number of real-time FER systems is less than that of non-real-time FER systems. Finally, the top-1 accuracy of 94.6% was achieved by the long-term recurrent convolutional network on the academic emotion dataset, and the limitation is that it has low illumination and a lack of frontal pose.

## 49. Neurophysiological Approaches to Lie Detection: A Systematic Review

**Authors:** Bewar Neamat Taha, Muhammet Baykara, T. B. Alakuş (2025)
**DOI/URL:** 10.3390/brainsci15050519

Background and Objectives: Lie detection is crucial in domains such as security, law enforcement, and clinical assessments. Traditional methods suffer from reliability issues and susceptibility to countermeasures. In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) and particularly the Event-Related Potential (ERP) P300 component have gained prominence for identifying concealed information. This systematic review aims to evaluate recent studies (2017–2024) on EEG-based lie detection using ERP P300 responses, especially in relation to recognized and unrecognized face stimuli. The goal is to summarize commonly used EEG signal processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms, identifying those that yield the highest accuracy in lie detection tasks. Methods: This review followed PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, restricted to English-language articles from 2017 to 2024. Studies were included if they focused on EEG-based lie detection, utilized experimental protocols like Concealed Information Test (CIT), Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), or Deceit Identification Test (DIT), and evaluated classification accuracy using ERP P300 components. Results: CIT with ERP P300 was the most frequently employed protocol. The most used preprocessing method was Bandpass Filtering (BPF), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) emerged as the preferred feature extraction technique due to its suitability for non-stationary EEG signals. Among classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were frequently utilized. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid and deep learning-based models in enhancing classification performance. Conclusions: EEG-based lie detection, particularly using the ERP P300 response to face recognition tasks, shows promising accuracy and robustness compared to traditional polygraph methods. Combining advanced signal processing methods with machine learning and deep learning classifiers significantly improves performance. This review identifies the most effective methodologies and suggests that future research should focus on real-time applications, cross-individual generalization, and reducing system complexity to facilitate broader adoption.
